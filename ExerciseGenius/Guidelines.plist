                        <string>A warm up exercise should be performed at intensity levels between 1 and 4 METS. An appropriate warm up for light to moderate exercise would include activities such as a light jog or a brisk walk where you can maintain a conversation with a friend.

If you are planning on running, warm up with a light jog. If you are planning on jogging, warm up with a brisk walk. As long as you perform light to moderate intensity aerobic or muscular endurance exercise you will be able to complete a successful warm up.

                        <string>Exercise intensity is best described in metabolic equivalents or METS. One MET is achieved at rest, when the body uses 3.5 milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute. Though this sounds complicated it is just a measure of how much oxygen your body requires to match your current energy requirements. During exercise, oxygen consumption goes up as your metabolism goes up. Light Intensity exercise is defined as being less than 3 METS. Moderate Intensity exercise is defined as 3-5.9 METS and Vigorous Intensity exercise is defined as being greater than 6 METS. This app will help you identify what exercise intensity you are currently working at so that you can keep track of your progress towards the recommended allowance of aerobic exercise per week.

                        <key>Body</key>
                        <string>Duration is usually determined by the minutes of exercise performed. Currently, the recommendations for aerobic exercise are that you exercise for 30 minutes 5 days per week at a Moderate Intensity or &lt; 3 METS, or that you exercise for 20 minutes 3 days per week at a Vigorous Intensity. This application will help you keep track of how many minutes of moderate and vigorous intensity exercise you are accomplishing per week, and will allow you to upload that information to Health Vault.

                        <string>Walking and running are the most typical methods or modes of accomplishing aerobic exercise. However, other modes can be used such as: swimming, biking, stair-steppers, elliptical machines, etc. Though this app is designed to assist you with walking and running exercise, there is an option to enter exercise information from other modes that can then also be added to your Health Vault file.

                        <string>Strength as a component of overall health and fitness refers to muscular strength as well as endurance. Strength is a very important aspect of fitness and has its own recommendations separate from those for aerobic exercise. Strength training can be performed using specialized machines, free weights, or even your own body weight. Machines will be tailored to strengthen a specific muscle or group of muscles. Free weights, such as dumb bells, can be used for multiple exercises, as they are not quite as limited as machines. Lastly, body weight activities, such as push up, pull ups, and dips, can be done without the use of other equipment.

                        <string>Recommendations regarding frequency, as outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine, are no less than 2 to 3 days per week for muscular strength and endurance exercise. You can incorporate strength exercises more than 3 days per week, but it is important to allow your muscles to recover in between exercises. It is recommended that if you perform strength exercises with a certain muscle or muscle group, allow at least 48 hours of recovery before exercising that same muscle again.

                        <string>Recommendations for specific numbers of repetitions and sets within a strength exercise vary depending upon your exercise goals. The National Strength and Conditioning Associationâ€™s recommends 2-3 sets and no more than 6 repetitions if your goal is to increase muscular strength. If your goal is to increase muscular endurance, the recommendation is 2-3 sets and a minimum of 12 repetitions. If your goal is to increase power, the recommendation is 3-5 sets and 2-5 repetitions.

                        <string>Flexibility is an integral part of overall health and fitness, and it is recommended that stretching be included in all exercise regimens. Flexibility is the range of motion a joint has the ability to move through and limited flexibility can severely limit the types of activities an individual can perform successfully. There are several forms of stretching that facilitate improvement of flexibility. Static stretching is performed while your body is at rest, often described as sitting and holding. Static stretching is often used in activities such as gymnastics or ballet. Dynamic
                            stretching is performed while your body is in motion.

                        <string>The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that static stretching exercises should be performed no less than 2 or 3 days per week, and each body part stretched should be stretched at least 4 times in rotation. Stretching is most effective once the muscles involved are warm, so it is recommended to perform stretching exercises after aerobic or strength exercises.

                        <string>The current recommendation for stretching exercise duration is no less than 10 minutes. In that time all of the major muscle groups should be stretched. The recommendation for duration of individual stretches is that each stretch performed should be held for an average of 30 seconds. No stretch should be held for more than 2 minutes.
